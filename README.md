# Landing for a Cause

## Our chosen NGO

Foundation for Intellectuals in Science (Alapítvány a reálértelmiségért)

The shamefully undervalued Foundation for Intellectuals in Science was founded in 1991.
Their hardships began when they had to wait only for their registration until March 6, 1992. 
However, they did not give up, because they had a noble mission to follow:
- to make the dignity and appreciation of intellectuals in science great again,
- not to rest until all their problems have been solved,
- to find jobs especially for technicians and engineers losing their jobs due to an evil world,
- to organize conferences and debates to achieve their goals and increase social awareness.

They are primarily dedicated to enabling companies looking for qualified
staff and suitable job-seekers to meet and start a successful cooperation.
In order to make that dream come true, they also launched a website.
But then they had to face new challenges.
Registration did not work on their website.
They had no programs to upload.
One of their emails had become obsolete.
Their website did not generate too many landings.
Although they had contacts to rich sponsors and international organizations,
everyone seemed to have left them alone with their tribulations.

It was the moment when we, the FRONTEND WARRIORS, heard their silent cry for help,
and braced ourselves to fight for justice and a better world...
