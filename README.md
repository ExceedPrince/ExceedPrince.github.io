# Landing for a Cause

## Our chosen NGO

Foundation for Intellectuals in Science (Alapítvány a reálértelmiségért)

The shamefully undervalued Foundation for Intellectuals in Science was founded in 1991.
Their hardships began when they had to wait only for their registration until March 6, 1992. 
However, they did not give up, because they had a noble mission to follow:
- to make the dignity and appreciation of intellectuals in science great again,
- not to rest until all their problems have been solved,
- to find jobs especially for technicians and engineers losing their jobs due to an evil world,
- to organize conferences and debates to achieve their goals and increase social awareness.

They are primarily dedicated to enabling companies looking for qualified
staff and suitable job-seekers to meet and start a successful cooperation.
In order to make that dream come true, they also launched a website.
But then they had to face new challenges.
Registration did not work on their website.
They had no programs to upload.
One of their emails had become obsolete.
Their website did not generate too many landings.
Although they had contacts to rich sponsors and international organizations,
everyone seemed to have left them alone with their tribulations.

It was the moment when we, the FRONTEND WARRIORS, heard their silent cry for help,
and braced ourselves to fight for justice and a better world...


## Story

It's always a great thing to help others. 
Maybe you're already helping out in a dog shelter, 
handing out food for people in need, collecting used cloth for charities or 
separate garbage to keep our planet clean. All little matters.

In fact, there are many NGOs (non-governmental organizations) specialized for some good cause. 
In this project, you'll have the chance to help one of them.

Choose an organisation who you'd like to help with a new website. 
Some of them already have great sites, this time, try to find one who lacks a site or has one,
but an old, not so useful one. 
They may work in any area.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to plan a landing page.
- How to create a wireframe.
- How to implement a whole website.

## Tasks

1. Choose an NGO, which could use a better website.
    - There is a clear topic, who is the subject of the website
    - There is an introduction of the NGO in the projects `README.md` file at the top

2. Like any real life project, an NGOs website should be also planned well.
    - There is a low-/mid-fidelity wireframe created and saved in the repository (as an image)
    - The wireframe was reviewed before any implementation started

3. You have great freedom on this project. Follow the linked articles on how a great landing page looks like and implement what is necessary for your chosen NGO to gain conversion.
    - There is a nice and clean landing page for the selected NGO
